# UGC Script Factory — Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Polish (Now → 3 months)

- Script performance tracking (link to ad platform)
- A/B hook variants
- More angle templates
- Script templates/examples

## Phase 2: Intelligence (3-6 months)

- **Winning script analysis** — Upload your top performers, learn patterns
- **Competitor script breakdown** — Paste TikTok URL, reverse-engineer
- **Performance prediction** — Score based on historical winners
- **Auto-persona from URL** — Scrape product page, generate personas

## Phase 3: Ecosystem (6-12 months)

- **Creator marketplace** — Match scripts with UGC creators
- **Brief-to-script** — Upload creative brief, get scripts
- **Script-to-video** — Integration with Synthesia/HeyGen for AI avatars
- **Platform integration** — Push to TikTok Creative Center

## Phase 4: Platform (12+ months)

- **Full creative workflow** — Script → Film → Edit → Post → Analyze
- **Creative asset management** — Organize all brand creative
- **Multi-channel** — Expand beyond short-form (YouTube, podcasts)

## Monetization Experiments to Consider

1. **Pay-per-export** — Generation is cheap, export shows intent to use
2. **Performance fee** — Take % of ad spend on winning scripts (hard to track)
3. **Marketplace cut** — 15-20% of creator payments
4. **White-label licensing** — Agencies resell under their brand
5. **API pricing** — Per-request for integrations
