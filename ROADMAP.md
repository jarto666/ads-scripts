# UGC Script Factory — Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Polish (Now → 3 months)

- Script performance tracking (link to ad platform)
- A/B hook variants
- More angle templates

### Project Templates

Pre-configured project setups for specific industries. Each template includes:

- **Sample personas** — 2-3 target audience profiles with pain points, desires, objections
- **Brand voice guidelines** — Tone and style appropriate for the industry
- **Forbidden claims** — Compliance phrases to avoid (FDA, FTC, platform policies)
- **Recommended angles** — Which of the 8 angles work best for this vertical

**Initial template ideas:**

| Template | Example Personas | Key Forbidden Claims |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Skincare/Beauty | Acne sufferer, Anti-aging seeker, Sensitive skin | "cures", "dermatologist approved", "clinically proven" |
| Supplements/Wellness | Fitness enthusiast, Busy professional, Health-conscious parent | "treats", "FDA approved", "guaranteed results" |
| SaaS/App | Small business owner, Freelancer, Enterprise buyer | "100% uptime", "#1 rated", "instant ROI" |
| E-commerce/DTC | Impulse buyer, Deal hunter, Quality seeker | "best price", "limited time" (if not true) |
| Finance/Fintech | First-time investor, Debt reducer, Side hustler | "guaranteed returns", "get rich", "no risk" |
| Fitness/Weight Loss | New year resolver, Postpartum mom, Busy executive | "lose X lbs", "burn fat", "no diet needed" |

**Implementation:** Templates page with preview → "Use this template" creates new project with all fields pre-filled → user customizes for their specific product

## Phase 2: Intelligence (3-6 months)

- **Winning script analysis** — Upload your top performers, learn patterns
- **Competitor script breakdown** — Paste TikTok URL, reverse-engineer
- **Performance prediction** — Score based on historical winners
- **Auto-persona from URL** — Scrape product page, generate personas

## Phase 3: Ecosystem (6-12 months)

- **Creator marketplace** — Match scripts with UGC creators
- **Brief-to-script** — Upload creative brief, get scripts
- **Script-to-video** — Integration with Synthesia/HeyGen for AI avatars
- **Platform integration** — Push to TikTok Creative Center

## Phase 4: Platform (12+ months)

- **Full creative workflow** — Script → Film → Edit → Post → Analyze
- **Creative asset management** — Organize all brand creative
- **Multi-channel** — Expand beyond short-form (YouTube, podcasts)

## Monetization Experiments to Consider

1. **Pay-per-export** — Generation is cheap, export shows intent to use
2. **Performance fee** — Take % of ad spend on winning scripts (hard to track)
3. **Marketplace cut** — 15-20% of creator payments
4. **White-label licensing** — Agencies resell under their brand
5. **API pricing** — Per-request for integrations
